<h2>The Details of Vijay Devarakonda</h2>
        <p>Deverakonda Vijay Sai (born 9 May 1989), professionally known as Vijay Deverakonda, is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Telugu films.
             One of the highest-paid actors of Telugu cinema, he has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2018 and has received several accolades, including a Filmfare Award, a Nandi Award, and two SIIMA Award.
                            Deverakonda made his debut with Nuvvila (2011) and received praise for his role in the coming-of-age drama Yevade Subramanyam (2015). 
             He rose to prominence as a leading film actor by starring in the blockbusters Pelli Choopulu (2016) and Arjun Reddy (2017), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance as a volatile surgeon in the latter.
             He further established himself with commercially successful films such as Mahanati (2018), Geetha Govindam (2018), and Taxiwaala (2018).
             This success was followed by a series of poorly received films such as the critically panned big-budget action film Liger (2022).
                        In 2019, Deverakonda launched his own production house King of the Hill Entertainment, which produced Meeku Maathrame Cheptha (2019) and Pushpaka Vimanam (2021).
                     Beyond his film career, Deverakonda has designed his own fashion brand Rowdy Wear, which launched on Myntra in 2020,
                     and is the co-owner of the volleyball team Hyderabad Black Hawks. Deverakonda is also a celebrity endorser for numerous products and supports various humanitarian causes.</p>
